                  <h3>What is Crossfit?</h3><br>
                  <p>
                    Constantly varied functional movements
                    done at high intensity. Now what does that mean?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Constantly varied, the WOD's (work out of the day)
                    will vary day to day. Sometimes it may be long or
                    sometimes it may be short. It might be with heavy
                    weights or body weight might do. It could high reps or low reps.
                    Think of it as your day to day, you never know whats coming.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Functional movements will mimic real life movements.
                    Such as squatting, lifting, pushing, and pulling.
                    CrossFit will better you for movements in life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    High intensity is how we measure our score for the day.
                    It's your hardest physical out put and doing it for time or reps.
                    This lets you measure your fitness level and helps you keep track
                    of your progress over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some core movements in CrossFit are weightlifting, gymnastics,
                    running, and rowing. These translate to the core movements of
                    day to day life. The skills you will gain are cardio-respitory
                    endurance, strength, stamina, flexibility, speed, power, agility,
                    balance, and coordination. Every WOD can be scaled to each
                    athlete's level.
